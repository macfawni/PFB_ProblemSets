Schooner by Shel Silverstein

Schooner loves me,
Schooner cares,
Schooner picks me peaches and pears.
Schooner offers me candy and Cokes,
Schooner listens and laughs at me jokes.
Schooner helps when I get in a fight,
Schooner does all my homework at night.
Schooner misses me,
Schooner cries,
Schooner thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Schooner is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Schooner just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Schooner's hand,
In the darkness where Schooner usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Schooner's gone!
